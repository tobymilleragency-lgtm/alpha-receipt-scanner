# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Receipt Wrangler is a full-stack receipt management and splitting application with OCR-powered scanning, AI-assisted data extraction, and multi-user group management. This is a **monorepo** containing three main components:

- **api/** - Go backend service (port 8081)
- **desktop/** - Angular 19 web interface (port 4200 dev, port 80 production)
- **mobile/** - Flutter cross-platform mobile app
- **docker/** - Monolith Docker build configuration

Each component has its own CLAUDE.md with detailed component-specific guidance. This file covers monorepo-level architecture and workflows.

## Monorepo Architecture

### Component Communication
- **API Contract**: OpenAPI 3.1 specification in `api/swagger.yml` defines the API contract
- **Client Generation**: API clients are auto-generated from swagger.yml using `api/generate-client.sh`
  - Desktop: TypeScript Angular client → `desktop/src/open-api/`
  - Mobile: Dart Dio client → `mobile/api/`
  - MCP: TypeScript client for MCP integration
- **Development Flow**: Changes to API → update swagger.yml → regenerate clients → update frontend

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go 1.24 with Chi router, GORM ORM, Asynq background jobs
- **Frontend**: Angular 19 with NGXS state management, Material + Bootstrap UI
- **Mobile**: Flutter with Provider state management, go_router navigation
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, nginx, PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite

## Docker Deployment

### Production Build (Monolith)
The `docker/Dockerfile` builds a single container with both API and web interface:
- Stage 1: Build Angular desktop app
- Stage 2: Build Go API and install dependencies (Tesseract, ImageMagick, Python)
- Final: nginx serves frontend, proxies `/api` to Go backend on port 80

### Development Build
The `docker/dev/Dockerfile` includes:
- All production components plus development tools
- SSH access for debugging (port 22, password: "development")
- Documentation site build from receipt-wrangler-doc repo
- Java runtime for OpenAPI generator
- Flutter SDK at `/opt/flutter` (on `PATH` via `ENV` and `/root/.bashrc`) with Linux desktop enabled and the `mobile/` pub cache warmed, plus `xvfb` + `libsecret-1-dev` so `mobile/run-e2e.sh` works out of the box

### Build Commands
```bash
# Production monolith
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t receipt-wrangler .

# Development container
docker build -f docker/dev/Dockerfile -t receipt-wrangler-dev .
```

## API Client Regeneration

When the API swagger.yml changes, regenerate clients:

```bash
# From api/ directory
./generate-client.sh desktop ../desktop/src/open-api
./generate-client.sh mobile ../mobile/api
./generate-client.sh mcp <output-path>
```

**IMPORTANT**: Never manually edit generated client code in `desktop/src/open-api/` or `mobile/api/`. Changes will be overwritten.

## Component Development

### Backend Development (api/)
```bash
cd api
go run main.go                    # Run API server
go test -v ./...                  # Run tests
./set-up-dependencies.sh          # Install system deps (first time)
```

See `api/CLAUDE.md` for detailed backend architecture and testing requirements.

### Frontend Development (desktop/)
```bash
cd desktop
npm start                         # Dev server with API proxy (localhost:4200)
npm test                          # Run tests with coverage
npm run build                     # Production build
```

See `desktop/CLAUDE.md` for Angular architecture, NGXS state management, and component structure.

### Mobile Development (mobile/)
```bash
cd mobile
flutter run                       # Run on device/emulator
flutter test                      # Run tests
flutter build apk                 # Build Android APK
flutter build ios                 # Build iOS app
```

See `mobile/CLAUDE.md` for Flutter architecture, Provider state management, and navigation.

## Critical Cross-Component Considerations

### API Changes Workflow
1. Modify backend code in `api/internal/`
2. Update `api/swagger.yml` to reflect API changes
3. Regenerate clients: `cd api && ./generate-client.sh desktop ../desktop/src/open-api`
4. Update frontend code to use new client methods
5. Test integration between components

### Authentication Flow
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Backend issues tokens in `api/internal/handlers/auth.go`
- Desktop stores tokens via NGXS persistent storage
- Mobile uses `flutter_secure_storage` for secure token storage
- All API endpoints except `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/signup` require authentication

### State Management Patterns
- **Backend**: Service layer handles business logic, repositories handle data access
- **Desktop**: NGXS store with actions/selectors, persistent storage for auth/preferences
- **Mobile**: Provider pattern with ChangeNotifier models, models own their state

### Background Processing
- Backend uses Asynq for async jobs (OCR processing, email polling, cleanup)
- Long-running operations (OCR, AI extraction) run as background jobs
- Frontend polls for completion or uses WebSocket-like patterns where implemented

## Version Management

Each component has version tagging scripts:
- `api/tag-version.sh` - Tag API version
- `desktop/tag-version.sh` - Tag desktop version
- `mobile/tag-version.sh` - Tag mobile version

Version is embedded in Docker builds via `VERSION` and `BUILD_DATE` build args.

## Data Persistence

### Development
- API defaults to SQLite in `api/sqlite/`
- Desktop proxy config in `desktop/proxy.conf.json` routes to localhost:8081
- Mobile configures API base URL in app settings

### Production (Docker)
- Volumes for persistent data:
  - `/app/receipt-wrangler-api/data` - Receipt images and uploads
  - `/app/receipt-wrangler-api/sqlite` - SQLite database
  - `/app/receipt-wrangler-api/logs` - Application logs
- nginx serves frontend from `/usr/share/nginx/html`
- API runs on same container, proxied via nginx

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgot to regenerate clients**: After API changes, clients are out of sync → regenerate!
2. **Editing generated code**: Changes to `desktop/src/open-api/` or `mobile/api/` will be lost
3. **Missing system dependencies**: API requires Tesseract, ImageMagick → run `api/set-up-dependencies.sh`
4. **Test database cleanup**: Failed Go tests leave `app.db` in test dirs → remove before rerunning
5. **Port conflicts**: API (8081), desktop dev (4200), docker prod (80) must be available
6. **CORS in development**: Desktop proxy handles CORS, but mobile needs proper API base URL

## Code Changes Philosophy

- Prefer minimal, targeted changes. Do not refactor or restructure code beyond what was explicitly requested.
- A primary focus of yours is overall code quality. Your focus should be on producing code that is stable, flexible when
  needed, readable and maintainable. You should not be writing code that is difficult to read, confusing, insecure or
  too long.
- Follow **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) pragmatically**. If two or more places share nearly identical logic that would
  need to be updated together, extract it into a shared utility, function, or component. This is not a dogmatic rule —
  three similar lines in a single file or minor template repetition is fine. Apply DRY when it meaningfully reduces
  maintenance burden, not for every tiny duplication.
- When the first approach fails, stop and ask the user for direction rather than trying multiple speculative approaches
  in sequence.
- After you have completed the planning phase, and you have your plan, please iterate over your plan at a maximum of 3
  times. During these iterations, your goals are to verify that your code makes sense, and solves the requested things,
  that your code is sound, secure and consistent with style across the codebase, and that your code is clean, and not a
  hacked together solution.

## Parallel Agent Execution

When a task spans multiple components (e.g., backend `api/` and frontend `desktop/` or `mobile/`), follow these rules:

- **Run backend and frontend agents in parallel** whenever possible. Do not serialize work across components unless
  there is a hard dependency.
- **Frontend agents should order their work to defer backend-dependent tasks.** If the frontend needs something from the
  backend (generated client, models, API endpoints), schedule that work last so independent frontend work happens first.
- **If the frontend agent is blocked on the backend agent** (e.g., waiting for a generated client, new API models, or
  endpoint changes), the frontend agent should:
    1. Continue planning its backend-dependent work (design the component, write the template, stub the types).
    2. **Wait** for the backend agent to finish before executing backend-dependent code. Do not guess at API shapes or
       generate placeholder clients.
    3. Resume execution once the backend deliverables are available.
- **The backend agent should signal completion clearly** — after finishing its work, the orchestrating agent should
  trigger any required client regeneration (e.g., `./generate-client.sh desktop ../desktop/src/open-api`) before
  unblocking the frontend agent.
- **Mobile (`mobile/`) changes** follow the same pattern: if a backend change requires a mobile update, run the mobile
  agent in parallel with the desktop agent after the backend agent completes.

### Example Task Ordering

For a feature that adds a new API endpoint and a corresponding UI:

1. **Phase 1 (parallel):**
    - Backend agent: handler → service → repository → route → tests → swagger update
    - Frontend agent: independent UI work (layout, styling, routing, non-API components)
2. **Phase 2 (sequential, after backend completes):**
    - Regenerate client (`cd api && ./generate-client.sh desktop ../desktop/src/open-api`)
    - Frontend agent: wire up API calls, integrate generated types, write dependent components
3. **Phase 3 (parallel):**
    - Backend agent: any follow-up fixes
    - Frontend agent: integration tests, final UI polish

## Testing

- After ANY code change, run the full relevant test suite before considering the task complete.
- When tests fail, fix both the code AND the tests — don't assume tests are correct or code is correct without
  verifying.

## Workflow Rules

- Always complete implementation AND verify (build + tests pass) before committing. Do not commit code that hasn't been
  validated.
- During your planning sessions, explicitly check if your planned code introduces regressions. We want to make sure that
  we do not break existing code, especially things that may not show themselves through build errors like scss changes,
  conflicting styles, and so on.
- During your planning sessions, take a moment to think if there are any edge cases, or possible regressions or any
  additional things for the user to test before considering the task complete.
- After implementing any full feature, always commit/push.

## CLAUDE.md Maintenance

- After modifying files in any component, check whether the corresponding `CLAUDE.md` needs updating.
- Each component has its own documentation: `api/CLAUDE.md`, `desktop/CLAUDE.md`, `mobile/CLAUDE.md`.
- If a change alters behavior, configuration, architecture, commands, or conventions documented in a `CLAUDE.md` file,
  update that file to stay accurate before considering the task complete.
