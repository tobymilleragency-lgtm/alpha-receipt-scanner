# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Receipt Wrangler Mobile is a Flutter mobile application that provides a native interface for Receipt Wrangler, a receipt management and splitting system. The app enables users to manage receipts on the go with camera/gallery uploads, receipt scanning, group management, and receipt splitting capabilities.

## Development Commands

### Core Flutter Commands
- `flutter run` - Run the app on connected device/emulator
- `flutter build apk` - Build Android APK
- `flutter build ios` - Build iOS app
- `flutter test` - Run unit tests
- `flutter analyze` - Analyze Dart code for issues
- `dart format .` - Format Dart code
- `flutter clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `flutter pub get` - Install dependencies
- `flutter pub upgrade` - Upgrade dependencies

### API Client
The project uses a generated OpenAPI client located in the `api/` directory. The client is imported as a local package dependency in pubspec.yaml.

## Architecture Overview

### State Management
The app uses Provider pattern with ChangeNotifier models:
- **AuthModel**: Authentication state, JWT tokens, API client configuration
- **GroupModel**: Group management and selection
- **ReceiptModel**: Receipt data, form state, and image handling
- **UserModel**: User profile and preferences
- **CategoryModel**, **TagModel**: Metadata management
- **SearchModel**: Search functionality with RxDart streams

### Navigation
Uses `go_router` with nested shell routes:
- **Group Selection Shell**: `/groups` with group selection UI
- **Group Context Shell**: `/groups/:groupId/*` with group-specific navigation
- **Search Shell**: `/search` with search interface
- Individual routes for receipt forms, viewing, and editing

### Core Directory Structure
- `lib/models/` - Provider-based state management models
- `lib/auth/` - Authentication screens and logic  
- `lib/groups/` - Group management, dashboards, receipts
- `lib/receipts/` - Receipt forms, viewing, image handling
- `lib/search/` - Search functionality
- `lib/shared/` - Reusable widgets and utilities
- `lib/client/` - OpenAPI client wrapper
- `lib/utils/` - Utility functions for auth, currency, dates, etc.

### Key Features
- **Receipt Management**: Create, edit, view receipts with items and images
- **Image Handling**: Camera/gallery upload with scanning capabilities
- **Group Management**: Multi-user groups with role-based access
- **Search**: Full-text search across receipts
- **Offline Support**: Secure token storage with refresh token flow

### Form Handling
Uses `flutter_form_builder` for complex forms with validation. Receipt forms support:
- Dynamic item lists with custom fields
- Image carousel with infinite scroll
- Category and tag selection
- Currency formatting and validation

### API Integration
- Generated OpenAPI client from backend specification
- JWT-based authentication with automatic token refresh
- Centralized client configuration in `OpenApiClient` singleton
- Secure token storage using `flutter_secure_storage`

## Development Notes

### Flutter SDK Setup (Claude Code Environment)

When working in the Claude Code environment, Flutter may not be pre-installed. To install the latest Flutter SDK on Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
# Prereqs. curl/git/pkg-config/xz-utils are usually already present; the rest
# are required for Linux desktop builds (needed for integration_test runs).
apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  unzip zip clang cmake ninja-build libgtk-3-dev

# Download and extract Flutter SDK. Check the current stable version at
# https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/releases_linux.json
# (the `current_release.stable` field names the hash; find its `version`).
cd /tmp && rm -rf flutter && \
curl -fL https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/linux/flutter_linux_3.41.7-stable.tar.xz -o flutter.tar.xz && \
tar xf flutter.tar.xz && rm flutter.tar.xz

# Fix git "dubious ownership" warning, add to PATH persistently, disable analytics.
git config --global --add safe.directory /tmp/flutter
grep -q '/tmp/flutter/bin' /root/.bashrc || echo 'export PATH="/tmp/flutter/bin:$PATH"' >> /root/.bashrc
export PATH="/tmp/flutter/bin:$PATH"
flutter config --no-analytics

# Verify and enable Linux desktop target (needed for ./run-e2e.sh).
flutter --version
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
flutter devices  # should list "Linux (desktop)"
```

After installing Flutter, standard commands work from `mobile/`:
```bash
cd /app/mobile
flutter pub get      # Install dependencies
flutter analyze      # Check for errors (recommended before building)
flutter test         # Run unit/widget tests
./run-e2e.sh         # Run integration tests on Linux desktop (see E2E Testing below)
flutter build apk    # Build Android APK (requires Android SDK — not installed by default)
```

**Note:** The base environment does not include the Android SDK or Chrome, so `flutter build apk` and web targets will not work without additional setup. Linux desktop + `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` + integration_test are fully supported.

### Regenerating API Client Models

After regenerating the API client with `generate-client.sh`, you need to run build_runner to generate the `.g.dart` files:

```bash
cd /home/user/receipt-wrangler/mobile/api
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Testing

Run tests with `flutter test`. Run a single file with `flutter test test/path/to/file_test.dart`.

**All new code must have accompanying tests.** When adding a new widget, utility, model, or service, add a corresponding test in `test/` that exercises:
- The happy path
- Sign / boundary cases (negative, zero, empty) where applicable
- Wiring contracts (validators, keyboard types, transformers) that downstream code depends on

Existing reference tests:
- `test/services/token_refresh_service_test.dart` — service unit tests with mocktail
- `test/widgets/amount_field_test.dart` — widget tests with FormBuilder + Provider
- `test/utils/currency_test.dart` — pure utility tests
- `test/helpers/widget_test_helpers.dart` — shared widget-test setup helpers
- `test/helpers/auth_test_helpers.dart` — shared mocks and JWT builders

#### Directory layout
Mirror the `lib/` tree: `test/widgets/` for widget tests of `lib/shared/widgets/...`, `test/utils/` for `lib/utils/...`, `test/services/` for `lib/service[s]/...`, `test/interceptors/` for interceptors. Shared helpers go in `test/helpers/`.

#### Flutter widget-test best practices

These patterns are followed by the existing tests; new tests should keep to them:

- **Use `testWidgets` (not `test`) for widget tests.** It supplies the `WidgetTester` and binds the framework.
- **Locate by `Key`, not by widget type.** Pass a `ValueKey` to the widget under test and use `find.byKey(...)`. When you need a specific descendant (e.g. the inner `FormBuilderTextField` of an `AmountField`), use `find.descendant(of: find.byKey(...), matching: find.byType(...))`. `find.byType(...)` alone breaks as soon as another instance lands in the tree.
- **Prefer `pump()` over `pumpAndSettle()`.** `pumpAndSettle` waits for *all* frames to drain and will time out against any continuous animation or formatting-on-change controller (e.g. `currency_textfield`). Reach for `pumpAndSettle` only when a specific test introduces an animation that has to flush.
- **Inject ChangeNotifier dependencies with `ChangeNotifierProvider`.** Use the `create:` constructor when the test owns the instance (auto-disposes); use `.value(value: existing)` only when the test reuses a model created elsewhere.
- **Prefer real model instances over mocks** when the model has no I/O and reasonable defaults (e.g. `SystemSettingsModel`). Mocking via mocktail is for models with I/O or where you need to verify interactions.
- **Only call `registerFallbackValue` when stubs use `any()` matchers.** Concrete `when(() => mock.x()).thenReturn(...)` does not need fallback registration.
- **Don't `tester.enterText` against `currency_textfield` (or any input with a controller that intercepts/reformats keystrokes).** It's fragile across package versions. Test the read path via `initialAmount` round-tripped through `valueTransformer`, and test the write path by inspecting the widget's `keyboardType`.
- **Register the custom currency in `setUpAll`** before any test that calls `exchangeCustomToUSD` / `exchangeUSDToCustom`. The shared helper `registerCustomCurrencyForTests()` in `test/helpers/widget_test_helpers.dart` is idempotent — call it once per test file.
- **Skip golden tests** unless the component is visually critical and the team is set up to maintain reference images.

#### Workflow

1. Write the test alongside the change.
2. `flutter analyze` — must be clean on the new files (the codebase has pre-existing warnings; only check the files you touched).
3. `flutter test` — must be all green.
4. If a test surfaces a real production bug (it happens — e.g. `Money.parse` of a leading `-` against the USD pattern), fix the bug as part of the same change rather than skipping the test.

### E2E Testing

End-to-end tests live in `integration_test/` (sibling of `test/`) and use Flutter's first-party **`integration_test`** package. They drive the real app against a running Go API, mirroring the desktop Playwright suite under `desktop/e2e/`.

**Stack choice:** `integration_test` SDK package. Not Patrol (we don't need native permission dialogs yet). Not the deprecated `flutter_driver`.

**Supported targets:** Linux desktop locally (`./run-e2e.sh`), and Android emulator in CI (`.github/workflows/mobile-e2e.yml`). The CI workflow is **advisory** (`continue-on-error: true`) and triggers only on pushes to `tech/mobile-e2e` + `workflow_dispatch` while we iterate. iOS simulator, CI-on-main, and PR triggering are still deferred — see the "Out of scope" note at the bottom of this section.

#### Prerequisites

1. **One-time system packages** (in addition to the Linux-desktop build prereqs from the Flutter SDK Setup section above):
   ```bash
   apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libsecret-1-dev xvfb
   ```
   `libsecret-1-dev` is needed to *build* the `flutter_secure_storage_linux` plugin (pkg-config fails the CMake step without it). `xvfb` is needed to *run* the Flutter desktop app headlessly — `run-e2e.sh` auto-wraps the test in `xvfb-run` when `$DISPLAY` is empty.
2. **One-time:** enable Linux desktop and install `integration_test`:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
   cd mobile && flutter pub get
   ```
3. **One-time:** seed the two e2e users. **Order matters** — the first sign-up is auto-promoted to admin. Use the desktop sign-up UI at `http://localhost:4200/auth/sign-up`:
   - Admin first: username `e2e-admin`, password `e2e-admin-password`
   - Then user: username `e2e-user`, password `e2e-user-password`

   Note: if `enableLocalSignUp` is `false` in the feature config, the signup UI/endpoint both 404. Either flip the setting in system settings, or ask the repo owner to seed the accounts — **do not seed via the API or by writing to the SQLite DB directly** (see the user memory on test data setup).
4. **Every run:** start the Go API separately (`cd api && go run main.go`). `run-e2e.sh` does not start the API — same pattern as Playwright.

#### Running locally

```bash
cd mobile && ./run-e2e.sh
# or a single spec:
cd mobile && ./run-e2e.sh integration_test/smoke_login_test.dart
```

`run-e2e.sh` sources `api/dev/switch-to-sqlite.sh` (which exports the `E2E_*` credentials), writes a temp JSON, and invokes `flutter test integration_test/ -d linux --dart-define-from-file=<tmp>`.

#### How env vars reach the tests

`String.fromEnvironment` is a `const` constructor — the **key has to be a literal**, so you cannot build it dynamically per role. `integration_test/helpers/env.dart` declares all five `E2E_*` reads as `static const` fields and exposes `E2eEnv.assertAdmin()` / `assertUser()` to fail fast when vars are unset.

**Never use `Platform.environment`** — it returns an empty map on Android/iOS. `--dart-define` is the only portable mechanism.

**Base URL gotcha:** the desktop suite's `E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4200` points at the Angular dev server, whose proxy forwards `/api` to the Go backend. The mobile app has no proxy — it hits the API directly. `run-e2e.sh` therefore reads `E2E_MOBILE_BASE_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:8081/api`) and maps it into the `E2E_BASE_URL` dart-define the test sees. Override for remote targets: `E2E_MOBILE_BASE_URL=https://demo.receiptwrangler.io/api ./run-e2e.sh`.

#### Writing tests

- **Bootstrap:** call `await tester.pumpWidget(buildApp())` (imported as `import 'package:receipt_wrangler_mobile/main.dart' show buildApp;`). `buildApp()` returns a fresh `MultiProvider` + `ReceiptWrangler` widget tree, with a per-`State` `late final GoRouter` so router location does not leak across `testWidgets`. Do NOT call `app.main()` from a test — `main()` triggers `runApp()` and `FlutterNativeSplash.preserve`, which conflicts with the test binding.
- **`IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`** at the top of `main()` in every spec file. Required — `testWidgets` without it runs as a unit test and fails to reach native channels.
- **Gate `installLinuxDesktopMocks()` on `Platform.isLinux`** (from `integration_test/helpers/platform_mocks.dart`), right after the binding. It stubs three mobile-only plugins whose method channels are unimplemented on Linux desktop and would otherwise throw `MissingPluginException` during app bootstrap:
  - `permission_handler` (channel `flutter.baseflow.com/permissions/methods`) — camera permission request in `lib/utils/permissions.dart`.
  - `gal` (channel `gal`) — image-gallery access in the same helper.
  - `flutter_secure_storage` (channel `plugins.it_nomads.com/flutter_secure_storage`) — backed by an in-memory map; real libsecret would need an unlocked gnome-keyring + dbus session, which is fragile in containers/CI.

  On Android/iOS these plugins have real native implementations and must be hit directly, so the `if (Platform.isLinux) { installLinuxDesktopMocks(); }` gate in `smoke_login_test.dart` is the template — copy it into every new spec.
- **Never use `pumpAndSettle` on the bootstrap frame.** `main.dart` renders a `CircularProgressIndicator` inside a `FutureBuilder` during auth init; the indicator's animation means `pumpAndSettle` never returns. Use `pumpUntilFound` (from `integration_test/helpers/pump.dart`) instead — it polls until a target finder hits, with a timeout.
- **Locators:**
  - `FormBuilderTextField` has no Key; match by its `name` field:
    ```dart
    find.byWidgetPredicate((w) => w is FormBuilderTextField && w.name == 'username')
    ```
  - `CupertinoButton.filled` with a `Text` child is `find.widgetWithText(CupertinoButton, 'Log In')`.
- **Assert navigation by widget presence**, not URL. After login, `pumpUntilFound(find.byType(GroupSelect))` is stronger than reading the go_router state — the widget is present iff the `/groups` shell has mounted.
- **Each test cold-boots.** There is no Flutter equivalent of Playwright's `storageState`. When the suite grows past a handful of specs, either accept the per-test login cost or introduce a non-UI setup step. Don't hand-write state sharing between tests.

#### Caveats / things that will bite

- **Headless display:** Flutter Linux desktop apps render through GTK and exit immediately without a display. `run-e2e.sh` auto-wraps in `xvfb-run` when `$DISPLAY` is unset. If you see "The log reader stopped unexpectedly, or never started," your display setup isn't working — check `xvfb-run --help` or set `DISPLAY` to a real X server.
- **`libsecret-1-dev` at build time:** the `flutter_secure_storage_linux` plugin's CMakeLists.txt does a `pkg_check_modules(libsecret-1>=0.18.4)` — if the dev headers aren't installed, the build fails with "The following required packages were not found: libsecret-1". Installed as a prereq above.
- **`libsecret` at runtime is avoided via mocks.** We don't bring up gnome-keyring + dbus for tests. `installLinuxDesktopMocks()` intercepts the platform channel with an in-memory map. If you ever want to exercise the real storage path (e.g. to reproduce a token-persistence bug), start a dbus session + gnome-keyring-daemon before the test — but don't do that by default; it adds a lot of fragile state.
- **Go API rate-limiter:** login is rate-limited. Rerunning the same test in tight succession can 429 — give it a few seconds between runs. The desktop suite notes the same issue in `desktop/e2e/helpers/auth.ts`.
- **DB accumulation:** tests write real rows (sessions, refresh tokens). Fine for a smoke test; when specs start creating receipts/groups/etc., build per-test uniqueness (UUIDs) into the data, mirroring the Playwright conventions.
- **Never commit credentials or the generated JSON.** `.e2e-env.json` is gitignored as belt-and-suspenders — the script already uses `mktemp`.

#### Out of scope (future work)

- iOS simulator (needs a macOS runner; significantly higher cost and complexity).
- Promoting the CI workflow from `tech/mobile-e2e` to `main` / PR triggers, and from advisory to required.
- Screenshot / video artifact capture on failure.
- `storageState`-style auth warmup across a multi-spec suite.
- Additional specs (receipt CRUD, group management, logout).
