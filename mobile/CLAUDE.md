# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Receipt Wrangler Mobile is a Flutter mobile application that provides a native interface for Receipt Wrangler, a receipt management and splitting system. The app enables users to manage receipts on the go with camera/gallery uploads, receipt scanning, group management, and receipt splitting capabilities.

## Development Commands

### Core Flutter Commands
- `flutter run` - Run the app on connected device/emulator
- `flutter build apk` - Build Android APK
- `flutter build ios` - Build iOS app
- `flutter test` - Run unit tests
- `flutter analyze` - Analyze Dart code for issues
- `dart format .` - Format Dart code
- `flutter clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `flutter pub get` - Install dependencies
- `flutter pub upgrade` - Upgrade dependencies

### API Client
The project uses a generated OpenAPI client located in the `api/` directory. The client is imported as a local package dependency in pubspec.yaml.

## Architecture Overview

### State Management
The app uses Provider pattern with ChangeNotifier models:
- **AuthModel**: Authentication state, JWT tokens, API client configuration
- **GroupModel**: Group management and selection
- **ReceiptModel**: Receipt data, form state, and image handling
- **UserModel**: User profile and preferences
- **CategoryModel**, **TagModel**: Metadata management
- **SearchModel**: Search functionality with RxDart streams

### Navigation
Uses `go_router` with nested shell routes:
- **Group Selection Shell**: `/groups` with group selection UI
- **Group Context Shell**: `/groups/:groupId/*` with group-specific navigation
- **Search Shell**: `/search` with search interface
- Individual routes for receipt forms, viewing, and editing

### Core Directory Structure
- `lib/models/` - Provider-based state management models
- `lib/auth/` - Authentication screens and logic  
- `lib/groups/` - Group management, dashboards, receipts
- `lib/receipts/` - Receipt forms, viewing, image handling
- `lib/search/` - Search functionality
- `lib/shared/` - Reusable widgets and utilities
- `lib/client/` - OpenAPI client wrapper
- `lib/utils/` - Utility functions for auth, currency, dates, etc.

### Key Features
- **Receipt Management**: Create, edit, view receipts with items and images
- **Image Handling**: Camera/gallery upload with scanning capabilities
- **Group Management**: Multi-user groups with role-based access
- **Search**: Full-text search across receipts
- **Offline Support**: Secure token storage with refresh token flow

### Form Handling
Uses `flutter_form_builder` for complex forms with validation. Receipt forms support:
- Dynamic item lists with custom fields
- Image carousel with infinite scroll
- Category and tag selection
- Currency formatting and validation

### API Integration
- Generated OpenAPI client from backend specification
- JWT-based authentication with automatic token refresh
- Centralized client configuration in `OpenApiClient` singleton
- Secure token storage using `flutter_secure_storage`

## Development Notes

### Flutter SDK Setup (Claude Code Environment)

When working in the Claude Code environment, Flutter may not be pre-installed or may be an outdated version. To install the latest Flutter SDK:

```bash
# Download and extract Flutter SDK (Linux)
cd /tmp && rm -rf flutter && \
curl -sL https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/linux/flutter_linux_3.38.6-stable.tar.xz -o flutter.tar.xz && \
tar xf flutter.tar.xz && rm flutter.tar.xz

# Fix git safe directory warning
git config --global --add safe.directory /tmp/flutter

# Add Flutter to PATH for the session
export PATH="/tmp/flutter/bin:$PATH"

# Verify installation
flutter --version
```

To find the latest stable Flutter version, visit: https://docs.flutter.dev/release/archive

After installing Flutter, you can run standard commands:
```bash
cd /home/user/receipt-wrangler/mobile
flutter pub get      # Install dependencies
flutter analyze      # Check for errors (recommended before building)
flutter build apk    # Build Android APK (requires Android SDK)
```

**Note:** The environment may not have Android SDK installed, so `flutter build` commands may fail. However, `flutter analyze` will verify that the code compiles correctly.

### Regenerating API Client Models

After regenerating the API client with `generate-client.sh`, you need to run build_runner to generate the `.g.dart` files:

```bash
cd /home/user/receipt-wrangler/mobile/api
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Testing

Run tests with `flutter test`. Run a single file with `flutter test test/path/to/file_test.dart`.

**All new code must have accompanying tests.** When adding a new widget, utility, model, or service, add a corresponding test in `test/` that exercises:
- The happy path
- Sign / boundary cases (negative, zero, empty) where applicable
- Wiring contracts (validators, keyboard types, transformers) that downstream code depends on

Existing reference tests:
- `test/services/token_refresh_service_test.dart` — service unit tests with mocktail
- `test/widgets/amount_field_test.dart` — widget tests with FormBuilder + Provider
- `test/utils/currency_test.dart` — pure utility tests
- `test/helpers/widget_test_helpers.dart` — shared widget-test setup helpers
- `test/helpers/auth_test_helpers.dart` — shared mocks and JWT builders

#### Directory layout
Mirror the `lib/` tree: `test/widgets/` for widget tests of `lib/shared/widgets/...`, `test/utils/` for `lib/utils/...`, `test/services/` for `lib/service[s]/...`, `test/interceptors/` for interceptors. Shared helpers go in `test/helpers/`.

#### Flutter widget-test best practices

These patterns are followed by the existing tests; new tests should keep to them:

- **Use `testWidgets` (not `test`) for widget tests.** It supplies the `WidgetTester` and binds the framework.
- **Locate by `Key`, not by widget type.** Pass a `ValueKey` to the widget under test and use `find.byKey(...)`. When you need a specific descendant (e.g. the inner `FormBuilderTextField` of an `AmountField`), use `find.descendant(of: find.byKey(...), matching: find.byType(...))`. `find.byType(...)` alone breaks as soon as another instance lands in the tree.
- **Prefer `pump()` over `pumpAndSettle()`.** `pumpAndSettle` waits for *all* frames to drain and will time out against any continuous animation or formatting-on-change controller (e.g. `currency_textfield`). Reach for `pumpAndSettle` only when a specific test introduces an animation that has to flush.
- **Inject ChangeNotifier dependencies with `ChangeNotifierProvider`.** Use the `create:` constructor when the test owns the instance (auto-disposes); use `.value(value: existing)` only when the test reuses a model created elsewhere.
- **Prefer real model instances over mocks** when the model has no I/O and reasonable defaults (e.g. `SystemSettingsModel`). Mocking via mocktail is for models with I/O or where you need to verify interactions.
- **Only call `registerFallbackValue` when stubs use `any()` matchers.** Concrete `when(() => mock.x()).thenReturn(...)` does not need fallback registration.
- **Don't `tester.enterText` against `currency_textfield` (or any input with a controller that intercepts/reformats keystrokes).** It's fragile across package versions. Test the read path via `initialAmount` round-tripped through `valueTransformer`, and test the write path by inspecting the widget's `keyboardType`.
- **Register the custom currency in `setUpAll`** before any test that calls `exchangeCustomToUSD` / `exchangeUSDToCustom`. The shared helper `registerCustomCurrencyForTests()` in `test/helpers/widget_test_helpers.dart` is idempotent — call it once per test file.
- **Skip golden tests** unless the component is visually critical and the team is set up to maintain reference images.

#### Workflow

1. Write the test alongside the change.
2. `flutter analyze` — must be clean on the new files (the codebase has pre-existing warnings; only check the files you touched).
3. `flutter test` — must be all green.
4. If a test surfaces a real production bug (it happens — e.g. `Money.parse` of a leading `-` against the USD pattern), fix the bug as part of the same change rather than skipping the test.
